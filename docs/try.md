# Try MailX

The fastest way to see what MailX feels like is the Docker demo.

## Run the Demo

```bash
cd demo
./setup.sh
```

Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
cd demo
./setup.ps1
```

## What You'll See

1. Three servers come up (a small federated network).
2. You register/login with the CLI client.
3. A first-time sender lands in Requests; accepting moves the conversation to Inbox.
